test both formats with the flags:

    -f -d -s -S -X -A -l -b 
    
test the injection methods:

    -t -j -J

usage: caveman.py [-h] [-f, --file FILE_PATH] [-d, --file-headers]
                  [-s, --section-headers] [-S, --search SEARCH] [-X] [-A]
                  [-l, --length LENGTH] [-b, --byte BYTE]
                  [-t, --target-offset TARGET] [-j INJECTION_FILE]
                  [-J INJECTION_STRING] [-P] [-B, --banner]

Find code caves in executables, inject your own code.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --file FILE_PATH  Location of file to search for code cave in (absolute
                        path)
  -d, --file-headers    Show File Headers
  -s, --section-headers
                        Show enumerated section headers
  -S, --search SEARCH   Section to search for code cave inside of
  -X                    Search all executable sections
  -A                    Search all sections
  -l, --length LENGTH   Number of bytes that constitutes a cave (default 64)
  -b, --byte BYTE       Byte to be searching for.
  -t, --target-offset TARGET
                        Target offset to inject shellcode
  -j INJECTION_FILE     A file of raw bytes to inject
  -J INJECTION_STRING   A string of raw bytes to inject supplied like \xef\xeb
  -P                    Include this flag to have caveman verify shellcode
                        fits in the code cave, and modifies permissions of the
                        section to allow for code execution



TEST FOR ls (ELF FILE):

-f: x

Okay so here's something to be aware of: This was originally written to have the program crawl ALL caves of the -l and -b parameters, and store them ALL. -P was meant to access them and their data later. So I need to refactor how it works: instead of crawling conditionally, crawl automatically, and change the conditional statements to apply to *printing* that kind of information.
